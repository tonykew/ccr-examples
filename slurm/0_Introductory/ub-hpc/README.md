## How to launch an interactive job on the ub-hpc cluster  

Use the `salloc` command and the same Slurm directives as you use in a batch script to request an interactive job session.  Please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/jobs/#interactive-job-submission) for proper setup of the request and command to use to access the allocated node.
