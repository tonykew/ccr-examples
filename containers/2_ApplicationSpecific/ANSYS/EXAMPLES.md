# ANSYS container examples

[ANSYS](https://ansys.synopsys.com) is a commercial suite of engineering simulation software products.

> Roswell Park researchers and other commercial users should utilize their own license with ANSYS products

UB provides an educational license for ANSYS.  The license is for **academic purposes only**
All the examples use the academic license file.

To run the GUI version of an application, use the [CCR OnDemand portal](https://ondemand.ccr.buffalo.edu)
Most of the GUI applications require a GPU to proveide GLX graphic support, as
shown in the example below.  

Open a browser window to our [OnDemand portal](https://ondemand.ccr.buffalo.edu)
and start a session with at least one GPU requested.  The first GPU will be
used for VirtualGL graohics acceleration.  
Note: If you request more than one GUI see the [CUDA section below](#graphics-acceleration-and-cuda-with-multiple-gpus

For example:

[UB-HPC & Faculty Cluster Desktop]

Cluster: UB-HPC  
Slurm Account: [Your Slurm account]  
Partition: [general-compute]  
Quality of Service: [general-compute]  
Number of Hours Requested: 4  
Number of Cores: 28  
Amount of Memory: 128000  
Number of GPUs: 1  

[Launch]

Once the Slurm job starts you can press the button that appears
[Launch UB-HPC & Faculty Cluster Desktop]

A new window will open with the GUI displayed.

Open a terminal with:
[Applications][Terminal Emulator]

load VirtualGL with:

```bash
module load gcc virtualgl
export VGL_DISPLAY="$(ls -d /sys/bus/pci/devices/$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_bus_id --format=csv,noheader | tail -1 | sed 's/^0000//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')/drm/card* | sed -E 's|^.*(card[0-9]+)$|/dev/dri/\1|')"
```

Note: If you want to verify that the VirtualGL acceleration is working, running
"glxspheres64" unaccelerated should generate 30 to 40 frames per second:

```bash
glxspheres64
```

Whereas running glxspheres64 with "vglrun" should generate over 260 frames per
second:

```bash
vglrun glxspheres64 
```

Set "PROJECTS_DIR" to the path to your projects directory
e.g.

```bash
export PROJECTS_DIR="/projects/academic/[YourGroupName]"
```

This example runs the ANSYS GUI application "cfx5"

```bash
vglrun apptainer run --nv --no-env=XDG_DATA_DIRS --writable-tmpfs \
 --bind "/util":"/util","/scratch":"/scratch" \
 --bind "${PROJECTS_DIR}":"${PROJECTS_DIR}" \
 --bind "/util/software/licenses/ansyslmd.ini":"/opt/ansys_inc/shared_files/licensing/ansyslmd.ini":ro \
 "/util/software/containers/x86_64/ANSYS-2026_R1-x86_64.sif" \
 icemcfd
```

You can replace "icemcfd" in the example above with any of the following:
cfx5, cfx5launch, cfx5pre, cfx5solve, cfx5posta, fluent, icemcfd, cfxtg,
runSherlock, runwb2

Note that, currently, "icepak" does not run in GUI mode, but the non GUI
"icepak_batch" can be used, for example:


```bash
apptainer run --nv --no-env=XDG_DATA_DIRS --writable-tmpfs \
 --bind "/util":"/util","/scratch":"/scratch" \
 --bind "/projects/academic/${CCR_GROUP}":"/projects/academic/${CCR_GROUP}" \
 --bind "/util/software/licenses/ansyslmd.ini":"/opt/ansys_inc/shared_files/licensing/ansyslmd.ini":ro \
 "/util/software/containers/x86_64/ANSYS-2026_R1-x86_64.sif" \
 icepak_batch [...]
```

## Graphics acceleration and CUDA with multiple GPUs

If you start an OnDemand job with multiple GPUs and use VirtualGL for graphical
acceleration, as our examples above do; you will likely want to use the last
GPU exclusively for VirtualGL acceleration, and the other(s) for CUDA
acceleration.  
Note: Not all ANSYS applications support CUDA acceleration.  

By default the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable is set to list all the
availabnle GPUs, for example:


```bash
echo ${CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES}
```

sample output for a two GPU job

> ```
> CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
> ```

In our examples, the "export VGL_DISPLAY=[...]" line configures VirtualGL to
use the last GPU, that is GPU numnber 1 in this case.  We will want to use the
other GPU(s) for CUDA, in this case GPU number 0  
For this example:

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```

Note that, unfortunately, not all programs resepct this value, but generally
the programs that don't will have command line option to secify the usable
GPUs.  Also GPU 0 is the default first CUDA device, so this will still work for
single CUDA GPU workloads that ignore CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
